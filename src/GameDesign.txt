Just an extra file to plan out some game design

Game Class:
	Has player object, to update it? Since game has ball. and that way game can update display
	Has Ball object
	Has computer?
	has decorations which dont matter
	Calls things like move player paddle, reset paddles (scored point), keeps track of score
	Pause screen? Can reset game, or just allow for a break
	Stores playable area, for collisions

Player Class:
	Stores paddle object
	Moves paddle object, and keeps track of where it needs to be reset to
	holds logic for collision block of paddle, and will need to communicate with the ball
		some sort of logic about the angle of attack? Ball hits center of paddle going 45 degrees, should bounce at
		equal angle, but if the paddle is moving, it adds speed in that direction
		Also keep in mind, if it hits the corner of the paddle, it changes things harsher
		Maybe paddle has some sort of chamfer - will need a texture for that, or to create a
		conglomerate shape - a rectanlge, with an invisible triangle in each corner for corner collisions

Computer Class:
	Same as player, except maybe paddle moves automatically towards the ball at, idk, 1/3 speed?
	This would mean the paddle should catch up to any relatively horizontal hit, but struggle with the
	quick angular hits. Will likely need to tweak this, maybe eventually add a difficulty toggle?

Main Function:
	Sets up game. Shows Intro screen:
		just a start button for now, maybe difficulty settings later?
		Two player option? just using WS and ^... wait is there not a down arrow symbol? regardless, that
		Maybe a way to set the game score? First to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25...
	Runs window and event loop
	Runs keyboard checks
